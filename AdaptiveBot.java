/**
 * AdaptiveBot
 * A bot which adapts its behaviour according to the environment characteristics.
 * It changes its strategy, based on the current environment (e.g. number of neutral planets in the map,
 * number of ships, etc.). Knowing which strategy to use has to be collected beforehand.
 * This requires running a number of games of your bots, and evaluate which bot performs best for a certain environment.
 * You should then add this to the data structure (in AdaptivityMap.java).
 * The DoTurn method can then query this data structure to know what strategy should be used for this turn.
 * This example provides two environment variables: the number of neutral planets on the map, and the average growth
 * ratio of these neutral planets.
 * <p>
 * We provide a possible implementation using the hash adaptivityMap, which maps lists of integers (representing
 * the environment) with names of bots. See AdaptivityMap.java
 * <p>
 * Interesting questions (you can probably come up with other questions yourself as well):
 * 1. Can you modify or extend the environment variables we use?
 * Maybe other things are interesting other than the number of neutral planets,
 * and the average planet size of these neutral planets.
 * 2. The table in AdaptivityMap.java is filled by us (randomly) with only two simple bots.
 * But how should the table really look like?
 * This means you should collect data on how all your previous bots (BullyBot, RandomBot, HillClimbingBot,
 * LookaheadBot and/or others) perform in different environments.
 * 3. Can you implement your other bot implementations in AdaptiveBot.java?
 * Currently the only strategies are BullyBot ('DoBullyBotTurn') and RandomBot ('DoRandomBotTurn').
 * Implement the bot strategies you used to fill AdaptivityMap.java here as well.
